# Viking Gyms

Code-Institute: User-centric-milestone-1

Viking Gyms is a new website being built for a gym company who want to promote themselves and their services by providing details about their gym, how it works, who they are, memberships
costs and images so people can get a quick look into the gym and see if it's the right place for them another thing they need to promote is anything else they offer like the 5 different classes they are currently running, benefits of becoming a member and how to use the gym even if your not a member.

## UX

This website is aimed at fitness enthusiasts or people who just want to start using a gym for any given reason, with this website i want to give the customer everything they could need
like:

- social media links that will show the customer more about the gym be it pictures, promotions, information.
- I want the website to provide information about any extras we provide like classes, and information on how we operate.
- To provide information that stands out like the student discount or the Â£0 joining fee.
- To provide detailed information about the memberships we offer, what's included and the process of joining.

Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

### Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

## JQuery
I have been testing my project throughout it's stages using:

 - Dev tool Audits
 - W3C Validator (CSS & HTML)

## Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
