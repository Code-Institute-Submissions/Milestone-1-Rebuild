# Viking Gyms
Viking Gyms Project: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute

This is my gym website which will represent Viking Gyms as show potential and existing customers who we are, how we operate and what we do.

## UX
User stories

As a gym enthusiast, I want to know what memberships the gym offers and if I get an introduction about it all.

- Use the menu to head to the memberships page.
- read the information to see what we offer.
- click the price to find out important information like introductions.

As a fitness coach i would like to be able to find their social media and leaarn about their trainers/classes.

- once on our website simply scroll to the bottom of the footer and you will find out social media links.

As a businessman, I don't get time to go to the gym much so I was just wondering how your 24/7 gym worked.

- use the menu to head to the about us page.
- there you'll find information on our 24/7 system and how it works.

### Strategy
My goal in the design was to make all the information easy to find but keep a low minimalistic feel to the website.

###  Scope
For the customer, I wanted to provide them with the information they needed to decide about joining Viking gyms.

### Structure
In the 'about us' i wanted to provide them with enough info to reduce their questions.

### Skeleton

### Surface
The Gray color scheme was chosen to give the website a modern feel.

### Technologies
HTML
CSS
Bootstrap (4.4.1)

## Features Left to Implement
In the future, I would like to Implement google maps and add a contact form so we can answer any questions.

## Testing
The User stories achieved the intended outcome of providing them with the information they needed.

Other testing methods i used are,

Dev tool Audits
W3C Validator
